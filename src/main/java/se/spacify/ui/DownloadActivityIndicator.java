 * downloads plugin and simply listens for the {@code bungalow.downloads.changed}
 * action (the documented contract published by
 * {@code se.spacify.plugin.downloads.DownloadActions#CHANGED}). This is the
 * cross-plugin reporting the broadcast system enables — the same pattern works
 * for menu items, in-app headers, etc.
